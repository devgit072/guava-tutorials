Guava Cache Overview  
Guava cache is excellent simple cache library developed by Google. It is simple in-memory cache implementations.
Note the word simple. It is not cluster aware cache and not suitable for distributed cache systems.
If you are looking for any such cache system which is cluster aware and scale across multiple clusters
then perhaps you can look to Ehcache or Infinispan Distributed Cache. Both are very powerful distrubuted cache
and configurable plus scalable.  
Guava stores the cache in in-memory. In this tutorials we will how Guava Cache can be implemented.

In Basic.java, we have implemented all necessary set of methods, to implement getter and setters of cache.
